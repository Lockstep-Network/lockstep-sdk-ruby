    # An Invoice represents a bill sent from one company to another.  The creator of the invoice is identified
    # by the `CompanyId` field, and the recipient of the invoice is identified by the `CustomerId` field.  Most
    # invoices are uniquely identified both by a Lockstep Platform ID number and a customer ERP "key" that was
    # generated by the system that originated the invoice.  Invoices have a total amount and a due date, and when
    # some payments have been made on the Invoice the `TotalAmount` and the `OutstandingBalanceAmount` may be
    # different.
