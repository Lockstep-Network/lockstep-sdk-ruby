    # Retrieves the Payment specified by this unique identifier, optionally including nested data sets.
    #
    # A Payment represents money sent from one company to another.  A single payment may contain payments for one or more invoices; it is also possible for payments to be made in advance of an invoice, for example, as a deposit.  The creator of the Payment is identified by the `CustomerId` field, and the recipient of the Payment is identified by the `CompanyId` field.  Most Payments are uniquely identified both by a Lockstep Platform ID number and a customer ERP "key" that was generated by the system that originated the Payment.  Payments that have not been fully applied have a nonzero `UnappliedAmount` value, which represents a deposit that has been paid and not yet applied to an Invoice.

    # Updates an existing Payment with the information supplied to this PATCH call.
    #
    # The PATCH method allows you to change specific values on the object while leaving other values alone.  As input you should supply a list of field names and new values.  If you do not provide the name of a field, that field will remain unchanged.  This allows you to ensure that you are only updating the specific fields desired.
